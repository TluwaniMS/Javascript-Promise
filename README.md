# Javascript-Promise

A Javascript `Promise` is a representation of a value/data that is still to be.

* `Producing Code`:

Code that is responsible for getting the required values/data

* `Consuming Code`:

Code that must wait for the producer to deliver the required data to be consumed or perform the defined data manipulations

A `Promise` is a Javascript object that links producing and consuming code.
